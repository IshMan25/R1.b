This small project is that of a personal library tacker. A website will keep record of wich books you have in your personal bookshelfs. You can search them by titles, arthur, and type of book and the site will tell you where in your shelves you can find your book so that you can spend more time enjoying and less searching. The site will be split into seperate subsections for each type of books like horror, fantasy, and more and each of the books will appear with their name and pictures wich you can hover over to seee more info. You can also narrow down the books with a filter button and search bar at the top of the website.
